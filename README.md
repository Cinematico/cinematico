## Introducing Cinematico
Cinematico is a free (open source), simple, elegant, customizable and automatic website solution for your YouTube or Vimeo account, channel or playlist. To get started, download Cinematico, upload to any PHP compatible server (check your server) and run the setup (no database required). Cinematico will automatically update your site whenever you publish new videos.

## Server Requirements
It doesn’t take much to run Cinematico on most PHP compatible servers, but here are the specific requirements for your reference:

* PHP 5.3.6+, compiled with the **mcrypt** extension.
* You’ll need **mod_rewrite** (or your server’s equivalent).
* Although not required to use Cinematico, having the **gd** library installed will make your install even better.

## Standard Installation
This will guide you through installing Cinematico into your website’s document root (e.g. **yoursite.com**).

* Download the latest version of Cinematico (**cinematico.zip**) included within your purchase confirmation email.
* Unzip the Cinematico package and upload the contents (via FTP or similar) to the root of your website.
* After everything has been uploaded, run the Cinematico installation by accessing your URL in a web browser.
* Enter a username, email address and password to install Cinematico.
